e.g. 
import Heading from "@/components/Heading";
--> create jsconfig.json, add the below text:
{
    "compilerOptions": {
        "paths": {
            "@/*": ["./*"]
        }
    }
}

- render SSG (static site generation) --> generated at build time
(export) use the generateStaticParams async function, return a list of objects: [{slug: "SLUG-NAME-1"}, {slug: "SLUG-NAME-2"}, ...]
export async function generateStaticParams() {
  const slugs = await getSlugs();
  return slugs.map((slug) => ({ slug }));
}
